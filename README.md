## Description

I made this repository to teach myself about user authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. I will be diving into the world of secure user authentication and authorization using JWT, and building robust and scalable web applications with this educational repository.
